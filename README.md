 Portland has an extremely vibrant and engaged group of local musicians. Being a part of this group I noticed we lacked a clear committed channel for communication about events, gear, shows, talent, and ideas.  This deficiency gave me the idea to create my app.  A simple, dedicated, and easy way for local musicians to communicate.

-The main technologies used in this app are React with Redux and Ruby on Rails.  React with Redux provides a  simple and seamless front-end user experience. Making the app attractive and accessible for different users of varying familiarity with web technologies.  Rails is used to create a Restful API and communicate with  postgres SQL database.  Generally, these two technologies work  together to make a  basic CRUD app in the style of a forum.  The application is simply and elegantly styled using the bulma css framework.
